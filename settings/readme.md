# Settings

The `client.cfg` and `keys.cfg` files are my personal settings and keybinds.

- RAM: 128GB DDR4 (Crucial Ballistix 3600MHz)
- SSD: 1TB NVMe (Samsung 970 Pro)
- Keyboard: Logitech G915 (tactile switches)

    - Set to 144Hz

## Client Config

## Keybinds

General ideas:
- Don't move hand position if you dont have to.
- They keys `q..t`, `a..f`, `z..c` are valuable; don't have low-priority binds on them.
- Mouse keys are always easy to reach and your mouse thumb is often unoccupied.
  - Extra side mouse buttons can be bound to `f13..f24` to get "extra" keys.
  - Extra side mouse buttons can also be important things that might be a stretch (e.g. `6` & `g`)

Non-Rust keybinds:
- Medal clip -> `f5`

Common rebinds:
- Hoverloot -> `+mouse3`, doesn't require odd hand movement while hoverlooting ('back' button).
- Altlook -> `+mouse2`, better ergonomics (push down on scroll wheel).
- Open chat -> `enter`, move a low-priority command off a high-value key.
- Show combatlog on console open -> `f1`
- Show combatlog_outgoing on console open -> `f2`

Uncommon rebinds you may like:
- Map -> `+c`, better ergonomics for looking at the map while still using movement keys.
- Voice -> `+mouse4`, better ergonomics ('forward' button).
- Drop item single -> `+comma`
- Drop item stack -> `+period`
- Equip while looting (altlook + hoverloot) -> `+t`, can be more ergonomic than `mouse2+mouse3`.
- Change seats -> `+f4`, move a low-priority command off a high-value key.
- Permanent crouch -> `z`
- Permanent map -> `home`
- Toggle FOV -> `+capslock`

Uncommon rebinds you may not like:
- Inventory -> `q` & crafting `tab`, swapped from default.
- Crouch -> `leftalt` & `leftctrl`, generally alt is easier to push than ctrl while moving, I leave ctrl bound for jump ups.

Custom bind commands:
- Auto run -> `p`
- Drop backpack -> `backquote` (`, above tab)
- Kill & respawn on specific bag -> `l`, out of the way to not press on accident.
- Toggle between push-to-talk and open-mic -> `v`
- TC stacking -> `pageup`
- Stone barricade stacking -> `pagedown`
- Comps stacking -> `end`

Binds for use with RustPlusBot:
- Toggle smart switch (usually SAM sites) -> `f8`
